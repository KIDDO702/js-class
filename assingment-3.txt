Assignment 1: Restaurant Reservation Eligibility

You are working on a restaurant reservation system, 
and you need to determine if a customer is eligible for a reservation based on their preferences and availability. 
Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user for their preferred time slot (morning or evening) and the number of available seats. 
The program should check the eligibility of the customer by applying the following conditions:

If the preferred time slot is "morning" and there are at least 3 available seats, the reservation is eligible.
If the preferred time slot is "evening" and there are at least 5 available seats, the reservation is eligible.
Otherwise, the reservation is not eligible.


Assignment 2: Online Shopping Discount

You are building a web application for an online shopping platform. 
Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user for their total cart value and their membership status 
(premium or regular). 
The program should check if the user is eligible for a discount by applying the following conditions:

If the total cart value is greater than or equal to $100 and the membership status is "premium," the user is eligible for a 20% discount.
If the total cart value is greater than or equal to $50 and the membership status is "regular," the user is eligible for a 10% discount.
If the user does not meet any of the above conditions, they are not eligible for a discount.

For each assignment, the program should prompt the user for necessary input and provide an appropriate message indicating whether the user is eligible or not based on the conditions.
