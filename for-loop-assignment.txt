Assignment: Student Grade Calculator

Imagine you are building a simple School Management System, 
and one of the essential features is a Student Grade Calculator. 
In this assignment, students will implement a program that calculates the final grade 
of a student based on their scores in various subjects.

Requirements:

1. Define an array of objects, where each object represents a subject and contains the following properties:
    -subjectName: The name of the subject (e.g., "Math", "Science", "English", etc.).
    -marksObtained: The marks obtained by the student in that subject (out of 100).

2. Implement a function called calculateFinalGrade that takes the array of subjects as input and returns the
   final grade of the student based on the average marks.

3. Inside the calculateFinalGrade function, use a for loop to iterate through the array of subjects and calculate the average marks of the student.

4. Based on the average marks, assign a final grade to the student according to the following grading scale:
    -90 or above: "A"
    -80 to 89: "B"
    -70 to 79: "C"
    -60 to 69: "D"
    -Below 60: "F"

5. The function should return the final grade.

Tips:

-Use a for loop to iterate through the subjects array.
-Inside the loop, calculate the sum of marks and then divide it by the number of subjects to find the average marks.
-Based on the average marks, assign the appropriate final grade using conditional statements.

Example: 
const subjects = [
    { subjectName: "Math", marksObtained: 85 },
    { subjectName: "Science", marksObtained: 78 },
    { subjectName: "English", marksObtained: 92 },
    { subjectName: "History", marksObtained: 70 },
    { subjectName: "Art", marksObtained: 60 },
];

const finalGrade = calculateFinalGrade(subjects);
console.log(`Final Grade: ${finalGrade}`);

OutPut:
Final Grade: B
